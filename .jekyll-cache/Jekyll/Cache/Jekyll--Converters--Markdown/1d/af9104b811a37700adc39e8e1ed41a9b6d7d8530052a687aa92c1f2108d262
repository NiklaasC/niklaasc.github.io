I"â<p>After running a simple static portfolio website for forever, Iâ€™ve decided to switch to running a blog. I was using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a> to host a static website, but Iâ€™ve switched to using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to generate a static website from a mix of HTML, <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/">Liquid</a> and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> (All still hosted on github).</p>
