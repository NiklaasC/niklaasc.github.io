I"Á<p>After running a simple static portfolio website for forever, Iâ€™ve decided to switch to running a blog. I was using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a> to host a static website, but Iâ€™ve switched to using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to generate a static website from <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> (All still hosted on github).</p>

<p>My hope is that by focusing on smaller personal experiments I will be able to better document my work, whilst giving me the opportunity to share fundamentals, tips, tricks and any hard-won experience Iâ€™ve gained.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s a beautiful thing when I find a small nook on the internet where someone has tackled and documented a problem I am trying to solve, and itâ€™s about time I paid that forward.</p>
