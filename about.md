# about

I am a freelance fabricator and creative technologist based in Bristol, UK.

My practise explores the anthropomorphisation of objects: in software, puppetry and robotics. Taking inspiration from the animal kingdom to invent the behaviour of objects.

I enjoy making the inanimate animate and emotional, playing with expectations and experimenting with human interaction.

I'd love to discuss any ideas or projects:
