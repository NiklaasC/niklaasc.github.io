After running a simple static portfolio website for forever, I've decided to switch to running a blog. I was using [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host a static website, but I've switched to using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate a static website from [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (All still hosted on github).

My hope is that by focusing on smaller personal experiments I will be able to better document my work, whilst giving me the opportunity to share fundamentals, tips, tricks and any hard-won experience I've gained.

It's a beautiful thing when I find a small nook on the internet where someone has tackled and documented a problem I am trying to solve, and I hope that I can pay that forward.
